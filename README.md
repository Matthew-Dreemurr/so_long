This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites. And some very basic gameplay elements.

## The constraints

* [ ] You must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in `Common Instructions` part.
* [ ] The management of your window must remain smooth: changing to another window, minimizing, etc.
* [ ] The map will be constructed with 3 components walls, collectibles, and free space.
* [ ] The player’s goal is to collect all collectibles present on the map then escape with minimal movement.
* [ ] At every move the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
* [ ] The player must be able to move: up, down, left, right.
* [ ] You will use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
* [ ] The game doesn’t need to be real-time.
* [ ] player cannot move into walls.
* [ ] The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:
  * [ ] The W, A, S, and D keys will be used to move the main character.
  * [ ] Pressing `ESC` must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
  * [ ] Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
  * [ ] The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.
* [ ] Your program must take as a first argument a map description file with the `.ber` extension.
  * [ ] The map must be composed of only 5 possible characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for map exit and P for the player’s starting position.
  * [ ] This is a simple valid map:

    ```ber
    1111111111111
    10010000000C1
    1000011111001
    1P0011E000001
    1111111111111
    ```

* [ ] The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return an error.
  * [ ] Map must have at least one exit, one collectible, and one starting position.
  * [ ] You don’t need to check if there’s a valid path in the map.
  * [ ] The map must be rectangular.
  * [ ] You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the rules of the map.
  * [ ] If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
